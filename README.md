# Watermation
a place to view your water sources and animate transport

### Why?
Being a lifelong SoCal resident, water has always been important aspect of life. Water sourcing, conservation, recreation, politics, and quality. One major event that inspired me was participating in the Eastern Municipal Water District's Solar Cup engineering competition at Lake Skinner about a decade ago; it really opened my eyes to the world of resource management and the effort that goes on behind the scenes. 

I'd also like to sharpen my geospatial skills and learn more about robust data visualization, web serving practices, and extracting useful insights.
